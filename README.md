# Attrition-analytics

## Synopsis
	This is our project done, during Big Data and analytics program in S.P.Jain global Mumbai.
	Have done attrition analysis on sample 	data provided by IBM watson.

## Problem Statement
	Analytics seems to be making a mark in almost every field, right from manufacturing till smart cities. Attrition hasn't remained untouched from it either. Every single company, be it large or small has to deal with employee attrition. Attrition rate is the rate at which companies hire or fire employees to either represent their firm or leave their firms. It is also referred to as the employee turn-over rate. Retirement is one of the major causes of employee attrition and as people retire around a specific age, this is one metric that can be accounted for and planned. The total number of employees that have joined for that particular month, the total number of employees who have resigned that month and the number of employees who have joined the company at the start of the month are some of the important metrics that define the attrition rate.  There is a lot of work done in this field, right from identifying attrition root causes to Churn prediction. This project would be an attempt to understand the analytics work done in this field. Perform feature engineering, PCA and apply different statistical modelling and data mining techniques.
The project should accomplish the following :
    - Identify attributes that could be indicative of ‘risk of leaving’?
    - Develop a model to predict employee attrition using features
identified.

	
## Motivation
	Purpose of creating this repository is to maintain a common location for the research work.	
	
	Contains multiple folders with defined purpose:
	1. DomainReseach : Contains domain specific research.references to the links refered.
	2. AnalyticsReseach : Contains the details about the analytics work done in this fiels.
	3. ExploratoryAnalysis : Contains Exproratory data analysis done on the data.
	4. Code : All the code written for the analysis.
